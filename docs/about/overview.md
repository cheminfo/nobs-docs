title: About the noBS Consortium
---

The noBS Consortium is a community rooted in natural product chemistry, pharmacognosy, and chemical ecology. Founded in 2019, it connects expertise across the analysis of natural and bioactive molecules, health products, and drugs.

Our goal is to advance natural productâ€“related fields, including biomedical sciences, by championing FAIR sharing of raw spectroscopic data (especially NMR), along with computational spectroscopy and theoretical chemistry. We focus on developing and disseminating modern analytical chemistry technologies, and on integrating spectral and structural datasets to build capacity for research and applications.
